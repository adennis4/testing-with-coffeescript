= Testing with CoffeeScript

Following the ebook by Jack Franklin - {"Testing with CoffeeScript"}[https://efendibooks.com/minibooks/testing-with-coffeescript].  The ebook demonstrates how to get started testing with Jasmine in CoffeeScript.  I set up a Rails app as opposed to the more basic implementation covered in the book.  I wanted to mimic how I would be applying Coffeescript and Jasmine in future Rails apps.
